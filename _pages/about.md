Welcome to my webpage!  I'm a Ph.D student from [ School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yinjun Wu](https://wuyinjun-1993.github.io/) . Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Infomation, Renmin University of China in 2025.

My research interest includes databases, data management and AI4DB.
